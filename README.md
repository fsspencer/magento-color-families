# Magento Color Families
This is a Magento 1.9 extension built for academic purposes.

The main idea is to expose how to perform the following actions within a custom module:

- Create a simple database table
- Create a relational database table (1 > n)
- Create a custom Model/Resource Model/Collection
- Create an Admin Section with a Form / Grid
- Consume custom values for a specific field in the Form
